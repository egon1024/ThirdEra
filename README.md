# ThirdEra
A D&amp;D 3.5 game system for Foundry VTT

## Note

This repository is being unapologetically vibe coded by the author.  If that
makes you not want to use it, you are absolutely free to make that decision,
but I will not be accepting criticism for this decision.

## Compendiums

ThirdEra includes compendium packs with SRD content to make character creation
immediate and easy. All compendiums are available in the Foundry VTT Compendium
sidebar:

- **Races** - All SRD races (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling, Human)
- **Classes** - All SRD base classes (Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Wizard)
- **Skills** - All SRD skills (35+ skills with proper ability scores and flags)
- **Feats** - Core SRD feats with prerequisites
- **Weapons** - Common SRD weapons (simple, martial, exotic)
- **Armor** - SRD armor and shields with full stats
- **Equipment** - Adventuring gear and containers
- **Spells** - Core SRD spells across multiple levels

### Using Compendiums

To use items from compendiums:

1. Open the Compendium sidebar in Foundry VTT
2. Find the compendium pack you need (e.g., "Races", "Classes")
3. Drag items from the compendium onto your character sheet
4. Items will be added to your character automatically

You can drag races, classes, skills, feats, weapons, armor, equipment, and spells
directly onto character sheets. All data fields will be populated correctly.

## Contribution

While this module is currently under development, I won't be accepting code
contributions, though I will certainly accept feedback from testers.  At this
time, I am not soliciting reports of missing features, or requests for
functionality.  

All of the above is likely to change as the module progresses.
