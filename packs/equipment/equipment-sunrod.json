It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes shadowy, and shadowy becomes normal light). A sunrod does not allow you to see in darkness. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p>",
