Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can't act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (see the Stunning Fist table in the SRD), and no more than once per round.</p>","special":"<p>A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level.</p><p>A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>","scalingTable":[],"prerequisiteFeatKeys":["improvedUnarmedStrike"],"prerequisiteBAB":8,"prerequisiteAbilityScores":{"str":0,"dex":13,"con":0,"int":0,"wis":13,"cha":0},"prerequisiteFeatUuids":[]},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
