Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level × its caster level × 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this base price.</p><p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.</p>","special":"","scalingTable":[],"prerequisiteFeatKeys":[],"prerequisiteBAB":0,"prerequisiteAbilityScores":{"str":0,"dex":0,"con":0,"int":0,"wis":0,"cha":0},"prerequisiteFeatUuids":[]},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
