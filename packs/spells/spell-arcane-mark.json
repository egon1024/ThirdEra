A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.</p><p>If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the same object.</p>","level":0,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":0}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"","schoolName":"Universal","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"0 ft.","target":"One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.","duration":"Permanent","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":27}
