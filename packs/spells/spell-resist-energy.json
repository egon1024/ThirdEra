The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen. The value increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. Resist energy absorbs only damage; the subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy.</p>","level":2,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":2},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":2},{"classKey":"paladin","className":"Paladin","level":2},{"classKey":"ranger","className":"Ranger","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":2}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"fire","domainName":"Fire","level":3},{"domainKey":"sun","domainName":"Sun","level":3}],"schoolKey":"abjuration","schoolName":"Abjuration","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Touch","target":"Creature touched","duration":"10 min./level","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates (harmless)","spellResistance":"yes-harmless","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":107}
