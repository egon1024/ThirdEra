You can suggest the same course of action to all targets, or different courses. Each target gets a Will save. If a target succeeds, it is not affected. If it fails, it follows the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"enchantment","schoolName":"Enchantment","schoolSubschool":"(Compulsion)","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]", "[Language-Dependent]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart","duration":"1 hour/level or until completed","savingThrow":"Will negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
