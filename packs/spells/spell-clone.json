{"name":"Clone","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone (soul must be free and willing). The original's remains become inert. If the original died of natural causes, cloning fails. You need a piece of flesh (at least 1 cubic inch) from the original's living body, kept from rotting. The duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When complete, the soul enters if the original is dead. The clone is physically identical and has the same personality and memories; treat as raised from the dead (level loss or 2 Con). The spell duplicates only body and mind, not equipment.</p>","level":8,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":8}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"necromancy","schoolName":"Necromancy","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Piece of flesh and laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).
