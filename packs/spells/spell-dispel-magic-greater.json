{"name":"Dispel Magic, Greater","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and that you can use a targeted dispel to end spells on multiple creatures or objects. You can use greater dispel magic to counterspell another spellcaster, or to dispel a spell that has been made permanent. When used to counterspell, you take a -4 penalty on the dispel check. When used to dispel a spell that has been made permanent, a successful check dispels the spell (rather than suppressing it for 1d4 rounds). You may make a dispel check (1d20 + caster level, max +20) against each ongoing spell; for each success the spell ends. For each creature or object, you make one dispel check and apply the result to all spells on that target.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":5},{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":6},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"abjuration","schoolName":"Abjuration","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 30-ft.-radius burst","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
