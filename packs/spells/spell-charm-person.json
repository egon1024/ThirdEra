If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.</p><p>The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"enchantment","schoolName":"Enchantment","schoolSubschool":"(Charm)","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One humanoid creature","duration":"1 hour/level","savingThrow":"Will negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":37}
