The duration depends on the material. Vegetable matter is 1 day/level; stone, crystal, or metal is 1 hour/level; other materials have durations between those. The maximum volume created is 1 cubic foot per caster level. You cannot create creatures or items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship (weapons, armor, glass, etc.).
