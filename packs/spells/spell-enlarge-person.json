{"name":"Enlarge Person","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person. Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"strength","domainName":"Strength","level":1}],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A pinch of powdered iron"},"castingTime":"1 round","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One humanoid creature","duration":"1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":55}
