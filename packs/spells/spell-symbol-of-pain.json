{"name":"Symbol of Pain","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of pain causes wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These pains last for 1 hour. The symbol can be triggered by creatures of a particular type, or by all creatures. The symbol is invisible and is triggered by reading it (or by passing within 60 feet, if you so choose). A successful Disable Device check (DC 28) can disarm the symbol. Magic trap guidelines apply. The symbol lasts until discharged or 1 hour per caster level. You cannot use a symbol of pain on a creature that is not subject to pain.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"necromancy","schoolName":"Necromancy","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Evil]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 1,000 gp (consumed)."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"0 ft.; see text","target":"One symbol","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
