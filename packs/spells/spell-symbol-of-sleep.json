When triggered, a symbol of sleep causes all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet to fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. The symbol can be triggered by creatures of a particular type or by all creatures. The symbol is invisible and is triggered by reading it (or by passing within 60 feet, if you so choose). A successful Disable Device check (DC 28) can disarm the symbol. The symbol lasts until discharged or 1 hour per caster level. Unlike sleep, the symbol affects all creatures of 10 HD or less.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"enchantment","schoolName":"Enchantment","schoolSubschool":"(Compulsion)","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 1,000 gp (consumed)."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"0 ft.; see text","target":"One symbol","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"Will negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
