{"name":"Hallow","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>Hallow makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. First, the site is guarded by a magic circle against evil effect. Second, all Charisma checks to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead take a -4 penalty (does not apply to druid version). Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature. Fourth, you may fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site; it lasts one year and functions throughout the entire site. Spell effects that may be tied include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. An area can receive only one hallow at a time. Hallow counters but does not dispel unhallow.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"evocation","schoolName":"Evocation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Good]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the hallowed area."},"castingTime":"24 hours","range":"Touch","target":"40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"See text","spellResistance":"see-text","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
