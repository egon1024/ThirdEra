Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil. Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"60 ft.","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":97}
