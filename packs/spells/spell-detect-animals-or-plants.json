You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant.</p><p><strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area. <strong>2nd Round:</strong> Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen. <strong>3rd Round:</strong> The condition and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location.</p><p>Conditions: Normal (90%+ hp), Fair (30–90%), Poor (under 30%, diseased, or injured), Weak (0 or fewer hp, terminal disease, or crippled). The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":1},{"classKey":"ranger","className":"Ranger","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":46}
