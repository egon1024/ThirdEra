Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.</p><p><strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of secret doors. <strong>2nd Round:</strong> Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location. <strong>Each Additional Round:</strong> The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"knowledge","domainName":"Knowledge","level":1}],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"60 ft.","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":47}
