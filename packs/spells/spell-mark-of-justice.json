{"name":"Mark of Justice","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>You draw an invisible mark upon the subject and state a behavior that will trigger the mark. When the subject commits the specified behavior, the mark activates. When activated, the mark curses the subject; typically you designate a condition that triggers the curse (e.g. when the subject attacks you, or when the subject again commits the proscribed act). The effect of the curse is up to you, but it cannot cause direct physical harm. Some typical effects include: geas/quest, insanity, or bestow curse. A remove curse removes the mark; attempting to remove the mark and failing triggers the mark. Dispel magic does not remove the mark. The mark is invisible and cannot be detected by normal physical inspection. A detect magic reveals it. The subject cannot voluntarily get rid of the mark unless they follow the course of action you prescribe.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5},{"classKey":"paladin","className":"Paladin","level":4}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"necromancy","schoolName":"Necromancy","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Curse]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Touch","target":"Creature touched","duration":"Permanent","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
