The entity may be a deity, an outsider, the spirit of a dead sage, or some other mysterious being. The entity answers in a language you understand, but often briefly and cryptically. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The base chance of a correct answer is 70%; 5% per caster level above 12th. If the roll fails, you get \"no answer\" (50% chance) or a random answer (50%). No answer is stressful: you take 1d6 points of Intelligence and Wisdom drain. A random answer is as likely to be wrong as right. If the entity does not know the answer, it says so. Draining your Intelligence to 0 or Wisdom to 0 makes you comatose.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Personal","target":"You","duration":"Concentration","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
