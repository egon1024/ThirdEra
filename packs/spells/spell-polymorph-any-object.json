{"name":"Polymorph Any Object","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration depends on how radical the change is (same kingdom +5, same class +2, same size +2, related +2, same or lower Intelligence +2; duration factor 0 = 20 min., 2 = 1 hr., 4 = 3 hr., 5 = 12 hr., 6 = 2 days, 7 = 1 week, 9+ = permanent). Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object grants the new form's Intelligence. Damage to the new form can injure or kill the polymorphed creature. Nonmagical objects cannot become magic items. The spell cannot create valuable materials (precious metals, gems, etc.) or duplicate cold iron. Can duplicate baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.</p>","level":8,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":8}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"trickery","domainName":"Trickery","level":8}],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke (arcane); divine focus (divine)."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One creature, or one nonmagical object of up to 100 cu. ft./level","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates (object); see text","spellResistance":"yes (object)","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
