{"name":"Find the Path","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction and indicates at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take (e.g. trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding). The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round. This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":6},{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"knowledge","domainName":"Knowledge","level":6},{"domainKey":"travel","domainName":"Travel","level":6}],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Focus: a set of divination counters of the sort you favor."},"castingTime":"3 rounds","range":"Personal or touch","target":"You or creature touched","duration":"10 min./level","savingThrow":"None or Will negates (harmless)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
