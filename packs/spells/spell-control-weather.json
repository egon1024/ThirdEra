You control general tendencies (wind direction and intensity), not specific applications (where lightning strikes). Weather continues for the duration or until you use a standard action to designate new weather (manifests 10 min. later). Contradictory conditions are not possible. Control weather can dispel atmospheric phenomena as well as create them. A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a 3-mile radius.</p>","level":7,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":7},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":7},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":7}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"air","domainName":"Air","level":7}],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"2 miles","target":"2-mile-radius circle, centered on you","duration":"4d12 hours","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
