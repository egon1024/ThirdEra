It can be oriented in any way you wish (horizontal, vertical, etc.). A wall of force is immune to dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction can destroy it. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Gaze attacks and abilites that require line of effect do not pass through. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"evocation","schoolName":"Evocation","schoolSubschool":"(Force)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A pinch of powder made from a clear gem."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level","duration":"1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
