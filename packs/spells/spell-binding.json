The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level. You may have up to six assistants (suggestion or dominate spells) to increase your effective caster level. All binding spells are dismissible. Six versions: Chaining (antipathy, 1 year/level); Slumber (comatose, 1 year/level, save DC -1); Bound Slumber (1 month/level, save DC -2); Hedged Prison (permanent confinement, save DC -3); Metamorphosis (gaseous in jar, permanent, save DC -4); Minimus Containment (1 inch in gem/jar, permanent, save DC -4). You can set release conditions (+2 save DC). Dispel magic does not remove binding; antimagic field or Mage's disjunction does.</p>","level":8,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":8}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"enchantment","schoolName":"Enchantment","schoolSubschool":"(Compulsion)","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Props suited to binding type (500 gp), opals worth 500 gp per HD of target, vellum depiction or carved statuette of subject."},"castingTime":"1 minute","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One living creature","duration":"See text (D)","savingThrow":"Will negates; see text","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
