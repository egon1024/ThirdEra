The subject must have been dead no longer than 1 day per caster level. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return. The subject returns with 1 hit point per level; lost levels and Constitution are restored. The subject loses one level (or 1 point of Constitution if 1st level). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell. The subject is penalized -1 on all attack rolls, saves, and checks for every two levels lost; this penalty lasts 8 hours. The subject takes 1 point of Constitution drain (permanent) that cannot be healed by normal or magical means. Raise dead does not restore life to a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore a creature that has been turned into an undead.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"healing","domainName":"Healing","level":5}],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Healing)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Diamond worth at least 5,000 gp (consumed)."},"castingTime":"1 minute","range":"Touch","target":"Dead creature touched","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"None (harmless)","spellResistance":"yes (harmless)","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
