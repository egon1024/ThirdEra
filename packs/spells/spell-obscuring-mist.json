{"name":"Obscuring Mist","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. This spell does not function underwater.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":1},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"air","domainName":"Air","level":1},{"domainKey":"water","domainName":"Water","level":1}],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"Creation","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"20 ft.","target":"Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high","duration":"1 min./level","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":72}
