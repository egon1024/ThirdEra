The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average member of the new form in place of its own except: it retains the ability to understand (but not speak) languages it understood; it is treated as having its normal HD for effects based on HD; it retains its own hit points and alignment. The target loses all special abilities of its normal form, including class features. All items worn or carried fall to the ground.</p><p>If the new form would prove fatal (e.g. landbound creature into a fish), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand language and all memories of its previous form, and its HD and hit points change to match the new form. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune; creatures with the shapechanger subtype can revert as a standard action.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One creature","duration":"Permanent","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
