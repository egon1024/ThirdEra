{"name":"Detect Undead","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. <strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of undead auras. <strong>2nd Round:</strong> Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is overwhelming, and the creature has HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. <strong>3rd Round:</strong> The strength and location of each undead aura. Aura strength: 1 or lower HD = Faint; 2-4 = Moderate; 5-10 = Strong; 11+ = Overwhelming. An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":1},{"classKey":"paladin","className":"Paladin","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A bit of earth from a grave (arcane); divine focus (divine)"},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"60 ft.","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":49}
