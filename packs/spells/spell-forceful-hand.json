Treat this as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check. The hand always moves with the opponent to push the target back the full distance and has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. An opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"evocation","schoolName":"Evocation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Force]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A sturdy glove made of leather or heavy cloth (focus)."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"One creature","duration":"1 round/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
