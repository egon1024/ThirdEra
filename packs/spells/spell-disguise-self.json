You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.
