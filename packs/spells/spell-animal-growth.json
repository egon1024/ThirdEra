This alteration changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The creature gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity, and a +2 natural armor bonus. The creature's existing natural armor, if any, improves by +2. The creature's speed doubles. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its new Strength) to burst any enclosures. If it fails, it is constrained without harm. The spell does not change the creature's personality or mentality. Multiple animal growth spells do not stack.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"animal","domainName":"Animal","level":5}],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"One animal (Gargantuan or smaller)","duration":"1 min./level","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
