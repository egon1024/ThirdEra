{"name":"Mage's Private Sanctum","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the warded area from outside sees a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no light, and no divination spell can pass into or out of the warded area. The ward prevents scrying. A dimension door or similar spell cannot be used to enter. Teleportation and plane shifting can bring creatures in. The ward does not prevent creatures from seeing into the area from inside (they see and hear normally). Dispel magic can dispel the ward. A mage's private sanctum does not prevent the casting of spells into the area; it prevents divination and sound/light from passing in or out.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"abjuration","schoolName":"Abjuration","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"30-ft. cube/level (S)","duration":"24 hours (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
