First place your arcane mark on the item. Then cast this spell, which inscribes the item's name on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, speak a special word (set when the spell is cast) and crush the gem; the item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem. If the item is in another creature's possession, the spell fails but you learn who has it and roughly where.
