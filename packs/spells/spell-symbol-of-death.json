When triggered, the symbol slays one or more creatures within 60 feet whose combined current hit points do not exceed 150 (closest first). Once triggered, the symbol is active for 10 min./level or until it has affected 150 hp of creatures. Any creature entering the area while active is subject to it (one save per stay). The symbol must be in plain sight; covering or hiding it renders it inactive. Trigger conditions (look, read, touch, pass over, pass through portal) are set at casting; you can set a password or attune creatures to be immune. Dispel magic targeted on the rune removes it; destroying the surface triggers it.</p>","level":8,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":8},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":8}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"necromancy","schoolName":"Necromancy","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Death]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"0 ft.; see text","target":"One symbol","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"Fortitude negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
