The image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. It mimics your actions unless you direct it otherwise (move action). You can see and hear through it; while using its senses your body is blinded and deafened. Spells with range touch or greater can originate from the image; the image can't cast spells on itself except illusions. You must maintain line of effect; dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or similar breaks the spell.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"illusion","schoolName":"Illusion","schoolSubschool":"(Shadow)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A small replica of you (a doll), 5 gp to create."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"One shadow duplicate","duration":"1 round/level (D)","savingThrow":"Will disbelief (if interacted with)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
