The recipient remembers the dream upon waking. If the recipient is awake when you cast the spell, they know someone tried to contact them. You can choose to send a nightmare instead: the target does not get a save and takes 1d10 points of damage; the target is fatigued and cannot rest; after the nightmare the target remembers it. Alternatively, you can make the dream (or nightmare) appear to be a normal dream. To use the spell in this way, you must have touched the target. The target then gets a Will save; success means they realize the dream was sent by you.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"illusion","schoolName":"Illusion","schoolSubschool":"(Phantasm)","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a small feather (quill)."},"castingTime":"1 minute","range":"Unlimited","target":"One living creature known to you","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"None (harmless) or Will negates; see text","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
