If the highest Intelligence is 26+ (and at least 10 points higher than your own), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts. Each round you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":2,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":2},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":2}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"knowledge","domainName":"Knowledge","level":2}],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A copper piece (arcane); divine focus (divine)"},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"60 ft.","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"Will negates; see text","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":111}
