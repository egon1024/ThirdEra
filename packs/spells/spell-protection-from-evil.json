{"name":"Protection from Evil","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/shield.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature or to exercise mental control over the creature. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":1},{"classKey":"paladin","className":"Paladin","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"good","domainName":"Good","level":1}],"schoolKey":"abjuration","schoolName":"Abjuration","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Good]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Powdered silver (arcane); divine focus (divine)"},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Touch","target":"Creature touched","duration":"1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":73}
