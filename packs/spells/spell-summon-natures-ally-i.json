It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":1},{"classKey":"ranger","className":"Ranger","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"Summoning","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 round","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One summoned creature","duration":"1 round/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":94}
