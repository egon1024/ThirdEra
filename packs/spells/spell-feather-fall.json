{"name":"Feather Fall","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is an immediate action, allowing you to cast this spell even when it isn't your turn. Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"false","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 immediate action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart","duration":"Until landing or 1 round/level","savingThrow":"Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":59}
