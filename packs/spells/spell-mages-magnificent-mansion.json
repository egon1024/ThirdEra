The entry is a faint shimmer 4 ft. wide and 8 ft. high. Only designated creatures may enter; the portal closes and becomes invisible behind you. You can open it from your side at will. Inside is a magnificent foyer with chambers beyond; the atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains food for a nine-course banquet for a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (two per caster level) wait upon all who enter; they function as unseen servant except they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion. Outside conditions do not affect the mansion.</p>","level":7,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":7}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Creation)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Focus: a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon (each worth 5 gp)."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"Extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)","duration":"2 hours/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
