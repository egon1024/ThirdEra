You are invisible, insubstantial, and can move in any direction at half normal speed. You can move through solid objects and living creatures. You can see and hear on the Material Plane (limited to 60 ft.). Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. You cannot attack material creatures; spells you cast while ethereal affect only ethereal things.
