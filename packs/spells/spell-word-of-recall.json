You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry (up to your maximum load). You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (or equivalent) per three caster levels. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one must be in contact with you. An unwilling creature can't be teleported. A creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Teleportation)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"false","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Unlimited","target":"You and touched objects or other willing creatures","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"None or Will negates (harmless, object)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
