The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can react to the actions of creatures that interact with it, as long as you can see or hear what is going on. If you cease to observe the figment, it continues to follow the script. The figment can be of any object, creature, or force, as long as it fits in a 20-foot cube.
