{"name":"Summon Monster I","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level Summon Monster table (e.g. celestial dog, celestial owl, fiendish dire rat, fiendish hawk, etc.). You choose which kind of creature to summon. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":1},{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":1},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"Summoning","schoolDescriptors":["[see text]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Tiny bag and small candle (arcane); divine focus (divine)"},"castingTime":"1 round","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One summoned creature","duration":"1 round/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":81}
