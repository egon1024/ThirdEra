Plant the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude casting; the staff becomes a creature that looks and fights like a treant. It defends you and obeys spoken commands. It is not a true treant and cannot converse with treants or control trees. If reduced to 0 or fewer hp, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise the staff returns to normal when the spell ends or is dismissed, and can be used as the focus again. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created.</p>","level":7,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":7}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Focus: a quarterstaff of sound ash, oak, or yew limb, cured, shaped, carved, and polished (28 days to prepare)."},"castingTime":"1 round","range":"Touch","target":"Your touched staff","duration":"1 hour/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
