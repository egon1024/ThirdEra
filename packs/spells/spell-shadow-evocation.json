{"name":"Shadow Evocation","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. The spell is 20% real. For example, a shadow fireball deals 1 point of fire damage per die (minimum 1) to creatures that fail their saves, and the shadow wall of ice has 20% of the hardness and hit points of a real wall. Objects in the environment react to the shadow spell as if it were real. If the disbelieved spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong. If the disbelieved spell has a nondamaging effect, the effect is 20% likely to work. Unbelievers see the spell as a transparent, ghostly image.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"illusion","schoolName":"Illusion","schoolSubschool":"(Shadow)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"See text","target":"See text","duration":"See text","savingThrow":"Will disbelief (if interacted with)","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
