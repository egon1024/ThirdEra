The destination can be a place you have seen, a place you can describe, or a place you have studied. If you try to teleport to a place that is very familiar (studied carefully or often visited), you arrive exactly where you want. If the destination is only seen (casually) or described, you arrive 1d10 × 10% of the distance off target. If the destination is known only by description, you arrive 1d10 × 10% off target and 1d10 × 10% of the distance away. You can bring one object up to your maximum load, or one willing creature per three caster levels. Teleportation is not possible to or from another plane. Mishaps occur on a roll of 81–92 (similar area) or 93–100 (total failure).</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"travel","domainName":"Travel","level":5}],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Teleportation)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Personal and touch","target":"You and touched object or touched willing creature","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
