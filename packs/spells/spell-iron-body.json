You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.</p><p>You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -6 penalty to Dexterity (minimum Dexterity 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a -8 armor check penalty, just as if clad in full plate. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.</p><p>Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small or 1d6 for Medium), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone.</p>","level":8,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":8}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"earth","domainName":"Earth","level":8}],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A small piece of iron that was once part of either an iron golem, a hero's armor, or a war machine."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Personal","target":"You","duration":"1 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
