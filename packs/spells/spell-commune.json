(A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. \"Unclear\" is a legitimate answer. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given. The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":100,"materialDescription":"Holy (or unholy) water and incense."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Personal","target":"You","duration":"1 round/level","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
