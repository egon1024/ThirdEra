You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six at 18th). Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 damage; creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double. Reflex negates blindness and halves damage. An undead creature in the beam takes 1d6/level (max 20d6), or half on successful Reflex; undead harmed by bright light are destroyed if they fail the save.
