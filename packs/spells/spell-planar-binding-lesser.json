{"name":"Planar Binding, Lesser","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap. The creature can avoid the trap with a Will save. If it fails, it is caught for a period of time (depending on HD). You may ask the creature to perform one service in exchange for its freedom. The creature can try to break free with a Charisma check; the DC is 15 + your Cha modifier. Tasks that would be suicidal or result in the creature's death automatically fail. At the end of the service, the creature is released. The spell can call an elemental (Small or Medium), a devil (lemure, imp, or bearded devil), or another creature of 6 HD or less as noted in the spell description.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Calling)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A jewel worth at least 1,000 gp (consumed)."},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"Will negates","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
