It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), and the saving throw DC increases by 2. Certain rare items might work twice as well (each providing +2 on the caster level check and increasing the save DC by 4).</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":7}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"abjuration","schoolName":"Abjuration","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"true","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Focus: any item distasteful to the subject (optional, grants bonus)."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"Will negates","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
