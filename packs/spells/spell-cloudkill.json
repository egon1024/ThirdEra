{"name":"Cloudkill","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell generates a bank of fog similar to fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. The vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud). A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (Fortitude save halves). Holding one's breath doesn't help; creatures immune to poison are unaffected. The cloud moves away from you at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level; they cannot penetrate liquids nor be cast underwater.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Creation)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high","duration":"1 min./level","savingThrow":"Fortitude partial; see text","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
