Spells that affect metal do not function on ironwood; spells that affect wood do, but ironwood does not burn. With wood shape or wood-related Craft checks you can create wooden items that function as steel (plate armor, swords, etc.); druids can use these freely. If you make half the normal amount, any weapon, shield, or armor so created gains a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Wood shaped into the form of the intended ironwood object."},"castingTime":"1 minute/lb. created","range":"0 ft.","target":"An ironwood object weighing up to 5 lb./level","duration":"One day/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
