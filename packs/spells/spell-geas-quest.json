Instead of taking penalties to ability scores, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":6},{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":6}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"enchantment","schoolName":"Enchantment","schoolSubschool":"(Compulsion)","schoolDescriptors":["[Language-Dependent]","[Mind-Affecting]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"10 minutes","range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","target":"One living creature","duration":"One day/level or until discharged","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
