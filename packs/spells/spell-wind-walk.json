{"name":"Wind Walk","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as gaseous form) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally a wind walker flies at 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers appear misty and translucent. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round.</p>","level":6,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":6},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":7}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"transmutation","schoolName":"Transmutation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Air]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Touch","target":"You and one touched creature per three levels","duration":"1 hour/level (D); see text","savingThrow":"No and Will negates (harmless)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
