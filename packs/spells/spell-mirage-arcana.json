{"name":"Mirage Arcana","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. You can make a road look like a river, a clearing look like a dense forest, a pit look like a meadow, etc. The illusion is static and does not create sound, smell, or temperature. A creature that examines the illusion can attempt a Will save to disbelieve. If any creature succeeds, the illusion is still visible but the successful viewer sees it as a transparent image.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":5},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"illusion","schoolName":"Illusion","schoolSubschool":"(Glamer)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":"A piece of stone, wood, or other material from the area to be affected."},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","target":"One 20-ft. cube/level (S)","duration":"1 hour/level (D)","savingThrow":"Will disbelief (if interacted with)","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
