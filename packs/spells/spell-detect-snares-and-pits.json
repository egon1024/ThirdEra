The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps. It does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. It does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.</p><p><strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of hazards. <strong>2nd Round:</strong> Number of hazards and the location of each. <strong>Each Additional Round:</strong> The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>","level":1,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":1},{"classKey":"ranger","className":"Ranger","level":1}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"divination","schoolName":"Divination","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"60 ft.","target":"Cone-shaped emanation","duration":"Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":48}
