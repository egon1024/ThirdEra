The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus plus your Wisdom modifier. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, and as a force effect can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target.</p>","level":2,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":2}],"levelsByDomain":[{"domainKey":"war","domainName":"War","level":2}],"schoolKey":"evocation","schoolName":"Evocation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Force]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","target":"Magic weapon of force","duration":"1 round/level (D)","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"yes","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":121}
