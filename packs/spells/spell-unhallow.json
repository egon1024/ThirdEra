{"name":"Unhallow","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has four effects. First, the site is warded by a magic circle against good effect. Second, all Charisma checks to command undead gain a +4 profane bonus, and Charisma checks to turn undead take a -4 penalty. Third, any dead body interred in an unhallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature. Fourth, you may fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site; the effect lasts for one year. Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"cleric","className":"Cleric","level":5},{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"evocation","schoolName":"Evocation","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":["[Evil]"],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"true","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":"Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the unhallowed area."},"castingTime":"24 hours","range":"Touch","target":"40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point","duration":"Instantaneous","savingThrow":"See text","spellResistance":"see-text","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
