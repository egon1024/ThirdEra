Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You can move into a tree up to once per round for the duration. You need not line up the entry and exit trees. You can use this ability to move up to 500 feet per use (or less if you choose). You can pass through as many trees as you like in a single use, as long as the total distance is not more than 500 feet. If you choose, you can remain in a tree without passing to another; you are aware of the surroundings and can cast spells from inside the tree. You are considered helpless while inside the tree.</p>","level":5,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"druid","className":"Druid","level":5}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"conjuration","schoolName":"Conjuration","schoolSubschool":"(Teleportation)","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"true","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"Personal","target":"You","duration":"1 hour/level or until expended","savingThrow":"None","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0}
