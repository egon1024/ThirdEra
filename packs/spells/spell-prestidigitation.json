{"name":"Prestidigitation","type":"spell","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","system":{"description":"<p>Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.</p>","level":0,"levelsByClass":[{"classKey":"bard","className":"Bard","level":0},{"classKey":"sorcererWizard","className":"Sorcerer/Wizard","level":0}],"levelsByDomain":[],"schoolKey":"","schoolName":"Universal","schoolSubschool":"","schoolDescriptors":[],"components":{"verbal":"true","somatic":"true","material":"false","focus":"false","divineFocus":"false","xp":0,"materialDescription":""},"castingTime":"1 standard action","range":"10 ft.","target":"See text","duration":"1 hour","savingThrow":"See text","spellResistance":"no","prepared":0,"cast":0},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":26}
