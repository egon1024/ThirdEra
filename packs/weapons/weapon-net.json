    "description": "<p>A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or be unable to cast the spell.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).</p><p>A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p>",
